# COVID-19 in India

In this project I have analysed the data about Corona Virus in India.The dataset has been taken from the official website of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,Govt. of India(https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

The dataset contains information about every state,total no.of active cases in that state,total no.of deaths in that state and total no.of cured patients.The project involves performing various operations on the dataset to find out total number of people cured till a given day,total number of people found Corona positive till a given day, total number of deaths till a given day and total number of active cases till a given day.
