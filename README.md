#  Covid19 Data Analysis using Python

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has resulted in a pandemic.

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,most often via small droplets produced by coughing,sneezing,and talking.Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others,covering coughs,keeping unwashed hands away from the face and the use of cloth face coverings or masks to minimise the risk of transmissions.

In this project I worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also I used another dataset of worldwide happiness report which consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
