##  Covid-19-Data-Analysis-using-Python

In this project I worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also I used another dataset of worldwide happiness report which consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
